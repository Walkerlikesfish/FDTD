@article{sensor-cep,
	Abstract = {Dynamic measurement refers to problems in metrology aiming at modification of characteristics of measurement devices by signal processing. Prototypical dynamic measurement problems, used in the paper as illustrative examples, are speeding up thermometers and weight scales. The paper presents a system theoretic formalization of the dynamic measurement problem as an input estimation problem for a system with step input. If the process dynamics is a priori known, the dynamic measurement problem is equivalent to a state estimation problem and can be solved efficiently in the linear time-invariant case by the Kalman filter. In the case of unknown process dynamics, the dynamic measurement problem can be solved by adaptive filtering methods. A topic of current research, called data-driven dynamic measurement, is development of methods that compute the measurement quantity without explicitly identifying the process dynamics.},

@article{dynamic_sense,
	Abstract = {Dynamic measurement aims to improve the speed and accuracy characteristics of measurement devices by signal processing. State-of-the-art dynamic measurement methods are model-based adaptive methods, \ie, 1) they estimate model parameters in real-time and 2) based on the identified model perform model-based signal processing. The proposed model-free method belongs to the class of the subspace identification methods. It computes directly the quantity of interest without an explicit parameter estimation. This allows efficient computation as well as applicability to general high order multivariable processes.},
